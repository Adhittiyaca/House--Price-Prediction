Assignment-1: Comprehensive Study of Linear Regression Models
Tools: Python, Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook Group Activity
OBJECTIVE
To implement, analyze, and compare various Linear Regression models including Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Regularization techniques.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a dataset with multiple input features and a continuous target variable, perform end-to-end analysis using linear regression techniques and evaluate model performance.
DATASET REQUIREMENT
- Dataset must contain at least three input features and one continuous target variable.
- Dataset source may be Kaggle, UCI Repository, or synthetically generated.
PROCEDURE
Part A: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Load the dataset and display basic information.
2. Compute summary statistics.
3. Check missing values and outliers.
4. Plot feature distributions and correlation heatmap.
Part B: Simple Linear Regression
5. Select one feature and build a simple linear regression model.
6. Plot regression line and interpret slope and intercept.
Part C: Multiple Linear Regression
7. Build a multiple linear regression model using two or more features.
8. Interpret coefficients and evaluate using MSE, RMSE, and R².
Part D: Polynomial Regression
9. Apply polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships.
10. Compare linear and polynomial regression performance.
Part E: Regularization
11. Apply Ridge and Lasso regression.
12. Compare coefficients and discuss feature selection.
Part F: Model Diagnostics
13. Plot residuals vs predicted values.
14. Validate regression assumptions.
EVALUATION METRICS
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score
EXPECTED OUTCOME
Students will gain practical understanding of linear regression models, diagnostics, and model selection.
ASSESSMENT (20 Marks)
EDA and Visualization – 5 Marks
Model Implementation – 7 Marks
Evaluation and Comparison – 5 Marks
Interpretation and Conclusion – 3 Marks
RESULT
To be written by the student after successful completion of the experiment.
As part of the Linear Regression Lab Assignment, all students are required to create a GitHub account and a dedicated GitHub repository for this activity.
Each student must upload the following to their repository:
•
Python Notebook (.ipynb) containing the complete lab work
•
Dataset used (CSV/Excel)
•
Output plots/figures
•
Brief documentation in the README.md file explaining the objective, methodology, and observations
The repository should be public and properly structured. You will be required to submit the GitHub repository link as part of the lab evaluation.
This activity aims to help you learn version control, professional documentation, and industry-standard practices, which are essential skills for data analytics and machine learning professionals.
Please complete the GitHub setup and uploads before the next lab submission deadline
